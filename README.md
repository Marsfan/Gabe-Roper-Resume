# simple-resume-cv

Download the latest version of my resume as a pdf [here](https://github.com/Marsfan/Gabriel-Roper-Resume/releases/download/Resume.pdf)

This repository contains my resume, written in LaTeX. It reqires XeLaTeX to compile as
XeLaTeX supports the use of external fonts like I have implemented.

The formatting of the resume is a modified version of
[zachscrivena's simple-resume-cs template](https://github.com/zachscrivena/simple-resume-cv).
Please see his repository for documentation on how to use the template, but note that I have made
my modifications have removed some commands from the class.

Feel free to use this as the template for creating your own resume.

## Contributing
